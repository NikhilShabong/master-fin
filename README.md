+# Virtual Fitness Coach
+
+This project is a full‑stack prototype for a conversational fitness coach. It combines a React front‑end for onboarding and chat with a FastAPI back‑end that calls OpenAI models to provide tailored advice and workout plans.
+
+## Features
+
+- **Onboarding form** to collect user traits (sleep, nutrition, mindset, etc.)
+- **KPI selection** to choose fitness goals and compute a future trait vector
+- **Chat interface** where users can ask questions and receive advice
+- **Workout generator** that produces a weekly plan based on user archetypes
+- Uses embeddings to classify user input and JSON files to store habit, tone and workout data
+
+## Repository Layout
+
+```
+Backend/   # FastAPI service and data files
+Frontend/  # React app (Vite)
+```
+
+Important back‑end modules include `router.py` with the `/generate_advice` and `/generate_workout` routes and utilities such as `advice_generator.py` and `workout_generator.py`.
+The front‑end entry point is `Frontend/App.jsx` which handles routing between the onboarding form, KPI selection and chat components.
+
+## Setup
+
+### Back‑end
+
+1. Create a Python environment (Python 3.10+).
+2. Install dependencies:
+   ```bash
+   pip install -r Backend/requirements.txt
+   ```
+3. Set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI key.
+4. Start the API:
+   ```bash
+   cd Backend
+   uvicorn main:app --reload
+   ```
+
+### Front‑end
+
+1. Install Node.js (version matching the `package.json`).
+2. Install packages:
+   ```bash
+   cd Frontend
+   npm install
+   ```
+3. Start the development server:
+   ```bash
+   npm run dev
+   ```
+
+The React app will connect to the FastAPI server running on `localhost:8000`.
+
+## Data Files
+
+Several JSON files in the `Backend` directory provide habit suggestions, tone strategies and workout tailoring parameters. User submissions are saved to `Backend/responses.json` with a timestamp and ID.
+
+## Notes
+
+- The project uses OpenAI's GPT models (see `gpt_caller.py`). Ensure API access before running.
+- The data files are examples and can be expanded to cover more KPIs or traits.
